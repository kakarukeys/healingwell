For me the pains were truly debilitating & I could not. <br /><br />I went to PT today for an evaluation of my shoulder. Of all the joints that have been affected, I've had no improvement in one shoulder. He diagnosed it as a rotator cuff impingement. Never had any problem with that but he said its from all the weakness of surrounding muscles from not being able to use my arms/hands much since mid June. I feel like its some kind of domino effect - adverse reaction to remicade causes one set of problems and then another set and that causes something else. <br /><br />I'm still on Pred & taking Tylenol w/ codeine to take edge off sharp pains. They say it can take months to improve or longer. <br /><br />Just a suggestion, based on this experience - if you do decide to stop remicade because you just can't stand it any longer, make sure you have enough strength left to wade through what may be a long recovery....  My last dose of remicade was in early May. Still no regrets though. Remi got me my life back after horrible flare, and then there's this next chapter.... Learning about<strong></strong> lupus, demyelinating nerves, etc.... (I have a 6-inch stack of medical articles...) The honest docs are very clear about<strong></strong> what they still don't know about<strong></strong> the mechanisms at work, once the anti TNFs are introduced into our systems. I appreciate their candor.<hr class="PostHR" />55 yrs old. Ulcerative Colitis >10 yrs. For flares failed prednisone, cortenemas, mesalamines (hives, fever), 6mp (fever), Uceris. Remicade (began 12/13), severe flare vanished. Update 6/30/14: severe joint pains (migrating); prednisone 40 mg; stopped remicade.

I'm going to take 1-4 years slowly wading through my life direction and desires, and then I'll choose a new path.

I may need to see a pain management person like you did. <br />Your point about<strong></strong> stress sounds right. (Haven't yet checked for threads on it here.) I have seen and heard anecdotes of UCers flaring and taking a break to go off on a 6 month retreat & while there healing, followed by re-flaring on coming back to the work grind.  (Probably not a real option for most of us who need steady income to drop out for 6 months....)  but it does raise the question of what would happen to our UC with a dramatic change in context and reduced pace. Has anyone seen any studies on it?<br />That said, Transition brings stress too.  So, Thoreau, i wish you less stress as you are starting a whole new chapter, and I hope you find a better fit with work that aligns with what's fulfilling and supports your ability to get/stay healthier. <br />I appreciate your offer to answer questions since I'm still pretty new here.

Disclaimer–I’m not a doctor. I just read a lot of medical articles to follow my doctors’ thinking and ask questions. So what I say here may not be 100% correct. It’s what I think I learned.<br /><br />Severe joint pains can have several causes:<br />1-Extra-intestinal manifestation of UC (IBD more generally). It’s easy for docs to interpret our pain as just that, and give us medication to make it more tolerable. Some of patients with make a shorter interval (do remicade earlier than planned) to reduce joint pain, only to have it return after a few weeks.<br />2-Side effect of a medication (like we may get headache, dizziness, nausea to a drug). We whether it’s worth it (ask ourselves: do benefits outweigh yucky side effects).<br />3-Infusion reactions – immediate (ex. Anaphylaxis, hives) or delayed (ex. fatigue, joint pain, muscle aches, fever, for a few days). Can be mild, moderate, severe. We take Remicade pre-meds to prevent immediate. I don’t know if anything prevents these delayed reactions.<br />4-Antibodies to Remicade can show up as joint pains, but it’s also possible there are no clinical signs that antibiodies have formed (except for perhaps a flare). Definitive blood test can show it specifically. If positive, drug is ineffective, so it’s a waste to take it. More important, we aren’t getting maintenance drug we need. <br />5-Adverse reactions to Remicade – can be acute (w/in 24 hrs) or delayed. Mine was delayed, and it felt cumulative. I was diagnosed as Anit-TNF drug induced lupus (ATIL) and polyneuropathy. All symptoms better on prednisone. No pain after 6 wks still neuropathy & weakness but feeling better. Most (but not all) cases resolve, studies show. Will retest labs later, but it can take months or years for labs to return to normal. <br /><br />How did they diagnose this? Thinking back, clinical features seem most important – severe pain (excruciating, debilitating pain). Very bad 5 months into Remicade - in legs, knees, feet, with pain, stiffness, mild swelling, poor balance, weakness. By 6 months couldn’t move hands/fingers, arms, then up shoulders and neck. Worst were hands/wrists. Was it joint pain, muscle pain, nerve pain? Hard to sort out when pain is so severe. Also, pain was constant in some areas, but some pain moved around. (I consulted Lupus and Fibro sites here to see about<strong></strong> symptoms. Indeed, some were similar.) I read studies and meta-analyses. Here’s what I found out – again with disclaimer of “I’m not a doctor” so it may not be 100% correct. I hope to save you hours and hours I spent searching, so you can have more informed conversations with your doctors.<br /><br />TNF-alpha inhibitors are known to bring on new onset or exacerbate underlying disorders (ex lupus, neurological disorders associated with demyelination, heart failure, myalgias, lymphoma, can awaken Hep B, etc.). We know this before starting (They disclose it). We take our chances based on the odds. <br /><br />Lab work: I don’t know doctors’ protocol, and some are more data-driven than others. I think they first rule out infection, since Remicade weakens immune systems. They do CBC w/diff, metabolic panel, lots of specific tests: ESR, Sed rate (By the way, sometimes w/UC, neither ESR or Sed Rate may be elevated, especially if it’s very inflamed distally). Also Creatinine, C-reactive Protein, ANA (one indicator of lupus-like reactions),etc. They may test to see if we have formed other neutralizing antibodies – dsDNA, IgG, SS-A/Ro, Sm, RNP, scl, Jo1, p-ANCA, MPO, PR3, etc. Various labs if positive could suggest types of connective tissue diseases that may be at work with myalgias, vasculitis, etc. They want to be sure our organs aren’t damaged, esp kidneys…. Lot of folks have skin manifestations (I didn’t). Labs aren’t definitive. There are always ranges (like 30 to 100% of people with X are positive on Y test). So serologies give them a sense of what may be going on and what to rule out. At one point, I couldn’t turn my head due to neck pain. Ruled out meningitis. MRI of neck was done to check for demyelination. Negative, fortunately. An EMG and nerve conduction study was to investigate possible myopathy vs polyneuropathy. Affirmative for the latter. (They don’t know how to cure it, only how to medicate to make it less painful…. Tried some medications but couldn’t tolerate side effects ….)<br /><br />It’s clinical symptoms alongside labs that lead them to diagnose if we have another autoimmune disease in addition to UC. (By the way, some tests can be positive anyway in IBD.) With severe pain, I had several high positive tests common for people having lupus-like symptoms. The fact that they came on a few months into remicade (within first 6 months) is typical if it is going to happen, but it can be later. <br /><br />So I had those “paradoxical adverse events associated with Anti-TNF Agents”. If you Google that or Anti TNF Induced lupus (ATIL), you’ll see articles dating back from 2003 thru 2014. t’s still only a VERY SMALL percentage of people who have these reactions, let alone severe ones, like mine (and same for Thoreau, Happyday, Soystud, Canada Mark, if that's what you guys have...). Remicade (infliximab) seems to have one of the higher %s and a broader range of clinical symptoms than the others in this class of drugs. I still have no regrets about<strong></strong> taking it, and hoping prednisone & time will resolve it. <br /><br />And I'm still searching for my next UC maintenance drug, possibly Entyvio, but I see that it caused joint pains in the clinical trials...

Offering a positive experience as it appears to be resolving. <br />My last remicade infusion was in May. Stopped it due to disabling joint pain. To treat the anti-TNF induced lupus which emerged full force in June, I've been on prednisone and tapering slowly Since July. Down to 5 mg/day now (as of Oct 1) per instructions from rheumy. <br />So far I'm thrilled to report the joint pains are completely gone (altho some neuropathy is still present in fingers but bearable). Will redo lab work soon, to check for the various lupus markers, but they said it can take a year to return to normal - if it will indeed resolve. I am confident the class of anti-TNFs are creating these adverse reactions in some of us and I will never use them again. It's also well documented in extensive independent research.<br />Fortunately I have no UC flare yet. I know I need a UC maintenance med but still regaining strength. And full remicade wash out is of course required. <br />Thanks for all your support. I hope my story has been helpful. I'm sorry some of you are still suffering. There is a clear path to relief although there's risk of flaring. But Entyvio is both an induction & maintenance drug if needed. So we have an option. as well as other drugs under development. Just wanted to offer some optimism & reduce unnecessary suffering. The UC is bad enough. Suffering from the drugs intended to help us just doesn't seem right to me.

When I was first put on Remicade eight years ago, I was in such bad shape that my resulting UC remission felt like a perfect miracle. Until recently, I received Remicade every 6 weeks. The side effects took several months to form:<br /><br />1. I developed psoriasis-like lesions on my scalp (I believe Remicade does acknowledge this as a side effect now, but they hadn't initially). I apply a topical cream to soothe the areas, but the lesions have never totally disappeared and still itch and flake. Yuck!<br /><br />2. I also developed very dry eyes (my eye doctor said in layman's terms that my eyes, &quot;didn't produce enough tears.&quot; I told him my husband would beg to differ, LOL). My eye doctor says dry eyes might be less a product of the Remicade and more the fact that my body has an immune disorder and many things don't work correctly. [shrug] I don't know. <br /><br />3. In times of high stress, I would have migrating joint pain. One month my knee or foot would lock up, another month my hand would curl into an arthritic fist - no amount of soaking, gentle exercise, or topical cream seemed to help. I just had to wait (and hobble around) till the inflammation receded. At the time, I figured this was just my lot in life - that if my antibodies were unable to attack my medicated colon, they were taking out their anger elsewhere. I mentioned this debilitating joint pain to my colon doc(s) but I live in a backwater of medicine so they were unperturbed. If I complained too much they offered me Prednisone (with which I have a horrible history, and they know this! I always say no to Prednisone now). <br /><br />Unexpected development: A hiccup in insurance recently caused me to miss my every-6-weeks infusion. I am now about<strong></strong> 7 weeks overdue for an infusion (making it 13 weeks since my last one). Insurance still hasn't come through so don't know when I'll be approved to resume Remicade. Interesting thing is, the severe joint pain that had most recently plagued my feet, started receding about<strong></strong> 8-9 weeks after my last infusion. Now that it's been 13 weeks, the joint inflammation is negligible. I'm beginning to suspect that my joint pain was caused by the Remicade (I never had arthritic issues before the Remicade, it's just my self-destructing colon was so distracting at the time, I never thought to inventory the problems I didn't have then). <br /><br />Perhaps this unintended hiatus from the drug is showing me that Remicade's not something I should continue. Of course, if the insurance continues dragging its feet, this may be a moot point as my body will have built up a resistance by the time Remicade could be back in my system. <br /><br />FYI (and maybe TMI) - I'm on a maintenance dose of Asacol (6 750 mg tabs a day). I have mucus in my stool, but no blood as yet, and am due for a colonoscopy (groan) soon.</div>                <div class="PostToTopLink"><a href="#ttop">Back to Top</a></div>            </div>        </td>    </tr>	</table><div class="PostBottom"></div><div class="PostTop"></div><table class="PostBox">    <tr>        <td class="msgUser" rowspan="2">		    <img src="/community/posticons/transdot.gif" border="0" height="1" width="150" alt="" /><br /><a name="m3213734" /><a href="/community/profile.aspx?f=38&amp;m=3129960&amp;p=86897">Thoreau</a><br />Veteran Member<br /> <br /><img src="/community/posticons/transdot.gif" border="0" width="1" height="2" alt="" /><br /><span class="msgUserInfo">Date Joined Jul&nbsp;2009<br />Total Posts : 1924<br /></span>	    </td>	    <td class="msgThreadInfo PostThreadInfo"><img src="/community/posticons/transdot.gif" height="15" width="15" border="0" alt="" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Posted 10/14/2014 10:03 PM (GMT -7)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>	    <td class="msgThreadInfo PostEditControls"></td>    </tr>    <tr>        <td class="msgThread2 PostBoxBody" colspan="2">            <div class="PostBoxWrapper">                <div class="PostMessageBody">Hey vdyej!

I'm feeling good - no joint pain at all but some lingering neuropathy. And thankfully no UC flare despite no UC medication. The lab work is all back to normal now except for testing positive still on one of the lupus tests - but the rheumy is hopeful that will resolve with time. <br /><br />I don't think I would have recovered this quickly (ok, well, it has felt slow but steady) without prednisone. I know many of us stay away from it, but for me at this time, it really resolved most of the adverse effects from remicade. Just sharing my experience if any of you are in a similar situation on remicade or another anti-TNF. <br /><br />Also, for what it's worth, my rheumy is the one who was 100% clear on these adverse effects and how to treat me, and then shared the info on this clinical pattern with the GI, who hadn't been aware that this can happen. So my advice is to not let your GI run the show if these symptoms develop. It's just not their expertise. So hopefully there's excellent communication & then consensus on treatment. If not, for this phase of recovering from adverse effects, I'd stick with instructions from the rheumy. Really glad I did. And GI is standing by til I recover. I have a colonoscopy in a month to take a look & do biopsies. <br /><br />Hang in there. There's hope!<hr class="PostHR" />55 yrs old. UC >10 yrs after proctitus.

I don't thinking stopping Remi alone would have put me on a path to recovery from these adverse effects.<br /><br />Soy, yes, still on pred - down to 2 mg, so almost done.

I still have pretty severe body aches if I do not take Tramadol/Tylenol every 6 hours.  My GI doctor says that the pains then cannot be from Remicade because it is out of my system.<br /><br />I spoke to Remicade (the support phone number) and a lady told me about<strong></strong> its half life.  Essentially the medicines half-life is 7.7 to 9.5 days.  This decrease in its presence can happen 5 to 7 times.  So essentially the medicine can be in us between 38.5 to 66.5 days.  These are reported numbers, and obviously there are probably a few that rank on either side of things there.<br /><br />My GI says I can go on Humira now.  This doesn't make sense to me if he says that my pains aren't from Remicade... but I don't want to take Remi again anyways so it's fine.  To me going on Humira while I still have the pains would seem stupid, as then I couldn't distinguish what exactly was going on.  However, I do not want to flare either...<br /><br />I've told you before, that the Rheumatologist checked me over and said I didn't display signs of Lupus.  He didn't run any more tests at that time.  Previously he had checked my Vitamin D levels and also to see if there was any inflammation in my muscles, which there was not.  I do not have any sensory issues so I am doubting I have the nerve thing you mentioned.<br /><br />I see my options as either:<br />1. Go on another Anti-TNF drug.<br />2. Step back to an immunomodulator (6mp, Imuran, Methotrexate).<br />3. Go without medicines, or just take 5-ASA's again though they didn't help a ton.<br />4. Try Entyvio.<br />5. Try to somehow get LDN.<br /><br />I'm readying myself to take some sort of action on this.  I'm over five weeks late for a Remicade infusion and want to steady my situation before anything out of my control happens.<br /><br />Do you think I should ask for prednisone to help alleviate the pains?

I want to reply before I hop on an airplane for Thanksgiving travel (crazy to do today, but so be it). Sorry this is written quickly.<br /><br />Here's my thinking about<strong></strong> your situation, based on all that i've read and my own experience. You clearly have persistent severe pains. Your heavy-duty pain med is helping you deal with some symptoms, but it's not addressing the underlying cause(s?). What you heard about<strong></strong> the drug washout period is right. It will be gone. But who knows about<strong></strong> the damage it may have done to your system. Will it heal on its own? Do you need another drug to help? I used prednisone to help in addition to withdrawing Remi. I did it because the docs thought the pains indicated inflammation. And it worked for me. Pain free! <br /><br />A few things are possible for you, it seems. You may heal on your own, without another drug, but slowly. You were on Remi for 2.5 years. If your system didn't like it, that's a long time and you may take much longer to heal. <br /><br />And/or you may have the pains as an extra-intestinal manifestation of the IBD/UC or another disorder/disease that was either triggered by Remi or was underlying this all along. Several people do. I have severe osteoarthritis, and it appears I have some other auto-immune things. My rheumatologist (who has been excellent) suggested I see an endocrinologist, just for a consultation and fresh look, which I will do next. As for testing, it is hit or miss. Just because you had negative test results a while back, doesn't mean you wouldn't test positive now (ANA, for example, would indicate inflammation). And you may have something that isn't showing up in the tests - always a possibility. (For me, my sed rate & C reactive protein never show inflammation even when I'm severely flaring with UC.)  The effects of anti-TNFs as a class of drugs are still being documented. The medical articles go back well over a decade showing they have been problematic for a small percentage of us. I'm done with them for sure. I am <strong></strong>open to trying another mechanism of action.<br /><br />Also, I don't know if you have seen a neurologist. I did to help diagnose the pains. They were able to see if my pains were nerve related and/ or muscle related. You seem to have myalgias. What is that about<strong></strong> - a muscle related disease? (I recall you said that repeated activity-like gardening- is followed by weakness & pain). Bottom line on this is that I wasn't willing to take another UC drug (esp an anti-TNF) until I figured out the source of the pains and treated em. My thinking was that introducing a new drug wouldn't give it a fair chance. I needed a clean slate.<br /><br />As for going med-free for my UC, I just had a colonoscopy and i'm still looking good. I'm so grateful remicade got me this far. And prednisone took away the severe pains. Standing by with cortenemas in case i need something immediately. Also, knowing that entyvio is indicated for induction and remission. Watching the results from our pals who are taking it. So that's my game plan. Temporarily flying without a net on the UC front until i'm sure my system is as stable as possible before I try a new UC drug. <br /><br />If I were in your shoes, I'd consult other docs to diagnose the pains - what are they, where to do they think they come from, and what will help (not just a pain med). Maybe you need Mayo clinic if docs there aren't knowledgeable. Then turn to the next UC drug. I wouldn't try other UC drugs before knowing that, because it's not a clean slate. But that's just my thinking. I really wish you well. We have much to be thankful for in our lives, but pain like this is all consuming. My heart goes out to you. I'm so sorry you are still suffering. This disease and all that goes with it = a true test of our strength - and an endurance test as well. I have to run, and didn't take time to read this over - so hoping it makes sense and is helpful!

It makes such a huge difference to me to at least be able to occasionally relate to someone who has gone through the same struggles as me.<br /><br />I will mention to my GI doc about<strong></strong> prednisone and possible inflammation causing the pains.  I already spoke to him before this wash-out period about<strong></strong> them (after hearing about<strong></strong> it from you) but he said that would be more short term before and after an infusion of Remi.  Do you remember what doses you were on and over what period of time??<br /><br />I'm sure my system didn't like Remicade.  Almost immediately after being on it I began having a higher pulse rate like my body was just working harder to handle it.<br /><br />I'm basically with you on wanting a clean slate before I begin another biologic drug... but I don't know that that will happen.  I'm teetering back and forth between 6mp and Humira.  I would choose 6mp to give my pains a chance to go away before starting another biologic that could cause the same pains.  That way I would have a better idea from one to another what was going on with each.  With Humira there is a chance that I could have the same pains.  But, there is also a chance I respond very favorably to Humira and that the pains were from the mouse-protein part of Remicade.  ---Obviously it's a challenging decision.  I have another thread going here trying to distinguish which med to take and everybody has their own opinion.  My GI doctor right now says the pains aren't from Remicade but that I can begin Humira anytime.  If he really didn't think they were from Remi you'd think he'd want me back on it, but maybe he is respecting my thoughts about<strong></strong> it causing the pains.<br /><br />The neurology option is a good potential lead to try to determine the cause of the pains.  The pains from repetition of motion were joint pains... awful joint pains.  Otherwise in general my body just aches all over and I feel poisoned.  Thankfully I am basically normal with pain meds in me.  I just am seeing their effects wear off sooner and sooner and know I need to do something.<br /><br />As far as your going med-free... how bad were you before going on Remicade??  I almost always was able to go to work and such, but then flared so bad I was house-bound for a few weeks.  I could handle things if I got somewhat sick, but what I'm concerned with is going med-free and flaring so bad that I cannot leave the house.  That seems like a real risk unfortunately.  Right now I'm 5.5 weeks past due for an infusion of Remicade and am doing pretty well.  I have a dull burn in my left colon which is always there without Remi, but otherwise I'm holding up.<br /><br />I have to spend some time with my wife here so I will wrap this up for now even if the thoughts are not complete.  I'm on stand-by until next Monday and then I'll get calling some doctors about<strong></strong> things.  Thank you so much for the time you have put in on this site and in response to me.  I hope you're having a great holiday weekend!<hr class="PostHR" />&quot;The price of anything is the amount of life you exchange for it.&quot;<br />30/Male<br />Dx 2003.

Didn't do solumedrol with it, altho I know some drs prescribe it. I didn't do a concurrent immunosuppressant either - which the research shows will delay the onset of antibodies - because I can't tolerate 6MP. (It made me very sick.) I had higher pulse too, but I didn't connect the two. Each infusion was otherwise unremarkable - just fatigue for a few days after. It wasn't until about<strong></strong> 3 to 4 months on it that I started to notice what I attributed to arthritis or getting older(!), joint stiffness and muscle pain. But then at 5 months after that infusion, the pains took over my whole body and were excruciating. It hurt to move. It hurt to just lie there. Life came to a grinding halt. The rest of my story about<strong></strong> it, trying to diagnose is here. But to summarize: many people had hypotheses that my pains were due to antibodies against the remi, or remi's mouse protein, or just IBD. Those weren't the case for me. And some people have pain from remi and it just goes away by withdrawing it. Not me. I needed more help. Inflammatory markers were high enough to give the prednisone a try. Also the EMG & neuro testing was an important last step, after lots of lab work). <br /><br />My condition before remi was the worst flare I ever had and ever imagined possible - & it lasted 9 full months. I had trouble functioning most of the time. I rarely left the house. If I went to work, I wouldn't eat anything until I got home at dinner. All day & night spewing blood & mucous. (sorry for such vivid details) Had to change pads in underwear a lot due to leaking. I was anxious 24/7 - with tenesmus. Truly miserable. Tried several meds before remi. I delayed that decision for months because I was afraid of a heavy-duty biologic. Looking back, I wish I had started remi earlier so I wouldn't have had to flare for so long. I understand the real concern about<strong></strong> flaring again, so it's scary to be in this in-between period of no UC med. But I really believe this &quot;clean slate&quot; approach & have to let my system recover and get to a new equilibrium. We each have to make these judgment calls. <br /><br />I've read your posts carefully. It sounds like what you have is truly systemic. Pain meds aren't addressing the cause, so they only &quot;treat&quot; your symptoms. I think going to a knowledgeable neurologist and rheumatologist would be good next steps. Your GI in particular isn't helpful - that's an understatement! - since he dismisses that remi could be causing your pains and he says he has not heard of anti-tnf (or remi) induced pains. I personally think it'd be irresponsible for the GI to prescribe humira or anything else without getting your disabling pains diagnosed. He or you are just guessing, like a shot in the dark. Why would the doctor not support you in first determining what is wrong before adding other variables (new meds)? It doesn't make sense to me. I know the clock is ticking. I am sad to think of you there suffering, and it's affecting your relationships, like it did mine.... One last thing: when I was researching what could cause such pains, many folks with fibro and lupus said it look years to diagnose (for some like 15 yrs!) and they felt really bad psychologically because doctors didn't have answers and some doctors were dismissive. Truly adding insult to injury. It is bad enough to be so sick. To have to struggle to get the proper treatment is just so unfair - and it takes persistence when at times we don't have strength to even deal with being sick. Hats off to you for doing both - and hanging in there. I know what that feels like.<br />Please keep me/us posted. At this time of thanksgiving, feeling thankful we've connected.<hr class="PostHR" />55 yrs old. UC >12 yrs after proctitus.
