But after 5 months I began to get severe joint pain in hands/wrists & stiff muscles / some weakness in my legs.  I read previous posts on this, but I have heard more info & have different questions, so starting a new thread. <br />What happened: The pain began to get worse a week after my last infusion. It would move around, but mostly in hands/wrists, even up my forearms, & didn't emanate from one place consistently. It was at times painful, stiff, weak - couldn't hold anything, slight swelling. In the past 10 days, the pain became excruciating - couldn't use my hands or even lift my forearms to reposition slightly in bed. Very very scary.... <br />Finally rheumatologist did tests. Only some test results back so far including positive ANA - 1:320 homogeneous; negative for RA; seems negative so far for lupus. Dr days it's not drug-induced lupus.  Waiting for the rest of results, including Remi antibody test. <br />In the meantime I cancelled next Remi infusion (was supposed to be today) and 40 mg of prednisone has me moving again & much less pain. I want to taper but not sure how & worried pain will come back. Has this happened to anyone & do you have advice on tapering for this problem (rather than flare of blood/mucus).<br />Also, both the rheumy & GI specializing in UC think its an auto immune reaction to Remi. They said they are seeing similar symptoms esp within first 6 months of treatment. Also they see it occurring more often when Remi is administered as mono therapy (no concurrent 6mp - for example- which I'm allergic to --  and no concurrent solumedrol (sp?) - GI didn't want me to take unnecessary steroids). So I was more vulnerable to this, in retrospect. If you are taking Remi, you may want to ask about<strong></strong> this - I wish I had known!<br />As for moving forward, I feel such despair. They said the anti TNFs class of drugs, including humira, are causing similar problems. So I shouldn't take any of them. I don't know what to do next for maintenance for UC. I'm allergic to so many things - & so disappointed to lose my Remi liquid gold. (I tend to get delayed allergic reactions to drugs rather than immediate.) I was so hoping to do Remi long term. <br />Does anyone have a similar experience, or any suggestions? Looks like Vedo is a different kind of medication. But it's so new, that I'm concerned about<strong></strong> side effects, while Remi has been in use for decades so relatively well known. Feeling such despair & hoping that you experienced folks can advise - or at least commiserate... Thanks for any thoughts you have to offer.<hr class="PostHR" />____<br />Female 55.

Sorry to hear you've had similar symptoms. (Mine began with legs/knees too.)

I hope you don't continue to suffer & your new GI supports your decision.<br /> I've heard we can't resume Remi after stopping, but I wouldn't want to try it again.

Doctors spent considerable time ruling everything out last year, so I can only assume (with high certainty) that the Remi is causing this.<br /><br />I don't have an answer as far as switching drugs go... but I do medicate the pain away.<br /><br />My pains are worst in the morning.  I take two tramadol (50 mg each), two tylenol, and two lomotil.  Then I go back to bed for an hour.  After they kick in I am able to get out of bed easily... whereas without the pain meds I literally have a hard time moving in bed due to the pain.<br /><br />After six hours I take another dose of all those pills... and that gets me through the day usually.  Sometimes I take one more tramadol later in the day, but it keeps me up at night (like tonight), so I try not to do that too much.<br /><br />All these pains started about<strong></strong> 5-6 months after being on Remicade.  I am not on 6mp or Imuran.  I began Imuran a couple months before I started having these pains, and then stopped a month after because I thought I was getting sick (thought the pains were mono or something similar) too often.  Since then I haven't been back on Imuran and am doing fine UC wise.<br /><br />One time last spring (year ago) I tried delaying my infusion and began to flare almost immediately.  That wasn't fun.<br /><br />So, I'm just being patient with things.  I'm in a stress-filled situation in my life at the moment, so I'll see how the pains are once I'm through it.  They usually lessen some when I'm not stressed.<br /><br />My doctor has said we can switch me to Simponi or Humira if I want, because I've had to deal with these pains too long.  There is a chance that I'm reacting to the mouse protein part of Remicade and that one of those other drugs will help.<br /><br />Vedolizumab is another great option, so keep that in your pocket.  It's different than the systemic anti-TNF drugs, so it may help both of us without causing the pains.<br /><br />Also, I do get severe joint pain... but only when I do repeat motions for a bit.  I can't lift weights anymore, and doing things like digging (I made my wife some raised bed gardens this year) takes patience as I need to give my elbows plenty of rest so they don't kill me.  Man those pains hurt!<br /><br />This reply is scattered, but you aren't alone.

Since you are the first I know to stop the remi, I will be anxious to know if it stops the pain.  I did not know that the other tnf's can cause the same kind of pain.  My plan was to stop remi, and have the other drugs to fall back on if necessary.  Since the other drugs do not all use mouse protien, maybe they won't be as bad.  <br /><br />I had such high hopes for entyvio as it uses a chinese hamster (or goat) protien.  But the entyvio literature lists joint and muscle pain as a side effect they already know about<strong></strong>.  With remicade, it appears the joint and muscle pain did not show up as a side effect until after the initial trials and approval.    <br /><br />I share your feelings of despair also.  Seems like lots of people have this feeling.  I have seriously cosidered the surgery, but probably wouldn't be a good candidate.  Almost didn't make it through a surgery for renal cell carcinoma a few years ago - my year in hell - UC diagnosis, months of D on apriso, broke two ankles, had stones in bile duct, gallbladder disease diagnosed, rcc found and finally surgery to remove part of kidney and gallbladder.  After all this, when nothing else worked, I started on the remi.<br /><br />Please let us know if stopping remi helps the pain and whether it causes a flare.

I'm SO hoping the absence of remicade won't lead to another flare. I will let you know. <br /><br />I wonder how long remicade stays in our system. Does anyone know???  (My last infusion was nine wks ago. Maybe the Pred will help until I figure out what's next.)<br /><br />When I see the dr on Friday, I'll ask if they know what's causing the joint pain. My impression from our initial appointment is that it wasn't the mouse protein in Remi per se but it was that some of our bodies can't process the core mechanism of the anti-TNFs and have this kind of delayed reaction once it builds up. (I followed up & saw a few articles about<strong></strong> this in rheumatology medical journals.) Also, I'm not sure how to think about<strong></strong> it. Some folks may consider severe joint pain as a side effect, my own feeling is that it's more of an allergic reaction (the body is saying this stuff is unacceptable). I suppose there are technical definitions as to what's what, but the bottom line is whether one is willing to live with it. <br /><br />Thoreau, I'm in awe of your willingness to persevere. You seem heroic. And how did you get those stronger pain meds? (I was given only Tylenol with codeine. Didn't help at all.)<br /><br />I'm sure others are dealing with this challenge. Wondering if I'm too quick to stop Remi. I will keep you posted & hope others do the same. My sense is the drs are well intentioned and 'unevenly informed', so I deeply value the daily experience of our fellow UC'rs....<hr class="PostHR" />____<br />Female 55.

I will need to begin to taper prednisone soon, so concerned it will return. Fingers crossed! Thinking positive!<br />The bad news is that my doctors are still puzzling over several disturbing test results-- very high anti-dsDNA, positive ANA, positive p-ANCA, etc. And have ordered yet more tests. I've been searching widely on related forums here as well as medical journals to learn about<strong></strong> what these results may mean - lupus, vasculitus, etc.  (Oh - and yes by the way, my antibody test for remicade was positive too.)<br />What I have learned is genuinely eye-<strong></strong>opening. The potential harmful effects of the anti-TNFs for contributing to other auto-immune diseases are well-documented through many studies and meta-analyses. When I was scared to take remicade, it was due to lymphoma; that risk is so low that it seemed worth the risk. So I was willing. What I didn't realize was the many other auto-immune diseases that this class of drugs can trigger. And/or as some theorize that we are just more vulnerable to them all. Hard to say what causes what, but the correlations are undisputed. <br />In any case I just want to make sure we can all make informed decisions. In retrospect I was suffering with a long flare & remicade stopped it. I don't regret that decision. But, for what it's worth, I'm also glad the rheumatologist had me stop taking remicade as soon as the joint pains were severe and I couldn't function. My chapter with remicade is over. And I personally won't do any other anti-TNFs. <br />I know we don't have a lot of options (I'm allergic to all the other UC drugs except cortenemas), and all of the drugs have side effects and potential for severe adverse reactions. Entyvio is new and promising, but it will take years of experience to learn what it will do to us. Thanks to those of you who are brave and jumping in right away. I am pretty sure I will soon be joining you, once we get this situation managed. <br />I just want all of my fellow travelers to know these other diseases - in addition to having UC - are indeed very real and scary. I'm feeling overwhelmed trying to manage it all post-remicade. Feeling grateful to have access to medical specialists who care and most of all grateful for your continued support.

(Ouch! It hurt but was worth doing. I'll have to wait for full report.) So this is considered a different set of adverse events from the ATIL (lupus symptoms), and these neurological things have occurred with the whole anti TNF class of drugs.<br />So if anyone on remicade or humira has not only severe joint pain but also some weakness & sensory loss, it might be worth looking into whether you have this too. My rheumatologist got me to the neurologist to explore it. <br /> What I'm puzzling over at this point is whether it's drug induced or it just comes with the territory of UC, as you all have taught me that UC can be accompanied by other things - joint pain, and I think neuropathy (the inflammatory type but not demyelinating?), etc. The doctors seem to attribute this to the drug because it's new for me.  But I can't help but wonder if it's just in the mix of our UC auto immune vulnerability. <br />Any thoughts?<br />Still dealing with 'lupus-like' symptoms too and on prednisone and no flare yet thankfully....
