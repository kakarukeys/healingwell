Project roadmap is written in evernote, this is the backlog:

NER
	from nltk.chunk.named_entity import NEChunkParser
	chunker = NEChunkParser(train_data)
	healingwell_ner = chunker.parse

	-> modify text file -> read from text file -> nltk.chunk.util.conllstr2tree -> training -> save chunker using pickle
	-> chunk all posts -> extract entities -> update entity tables

	get rid of HTML tags in post_content
	get rid of non-user-generated tokens
	a new table for named entities
	a new table for M2M relationship between posts and named entities

display saved! message after saving

improve error_callback to use the default message display mechanism instead of alert, display error message related to forbidden error.

keep posting and putting with lots of error, in the end, user cannot access the API
	psycopg2.InternalError
	InternalError: current transaction is aborted, commands ignored until end of transaction block

what if id in http://127.0.0.1:5000/index.html#/workshop/ner_training_data/:id is invalid?
provide ways to manage user CUD
learn about angular modules and use it, put controllers in modules.
learn new features in angular.js
upgrade javascript libraries
improve flask app project layout
learn flask
comments
tests
prepare settings_local configs_local templates
allow for setting up the project for a new developer
respect robot rules
client-side form validation
eliminate the need to go to index.html to open front page on dev server
continuous improvement: improve security on client-side code: e.g. CSRF prevention on forms.
continuous improvement: make sure no error during crawling and all extractionws are done correctly
continuous improvement: improve security on server-side code: e.g. is password hashing secure?
	restrict operations on nertrainingdata by users to what they need only, post / put can be used interchangeably, so create and update permissions are not enforced
continuous improvement: support python 3+
