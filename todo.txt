Project roadmap is written in evernote, this is the backlog:

NER
	from nltk.chunk.named_entity import NEChunkParser
	chunker = NEChunkParser(train_data)
	healingwell_ner = chunker.parse

	text -> pre-processing -> ne_chunk -> nltk.chunk.util.tree2conllstr -> write to text file
	-> modify text file -> read from text file -> nltk.chunk.util.conllstr2tree -> training -> save chunker using pickle
	-> chunk all posts -> extract entities -> update entity tables

	a new table for named entities
	a new table for M2M relationship between posts and named entities
