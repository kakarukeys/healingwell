Project roadmap is written in evernote, this is the backlog:

NER
	from nltk.chunk.named_entity import NEChunkParser
	chunker = NEChunkParser(train_data)
	healingwell_ner = chunker.parse

	-> modify text file -> read from text file -> nltk.chunk.util.conllstr2tree -> training -> save chunker using pickle
	-> chunk all posts -> extract entities -> update entity tables

	a new table for named entities
	a new table for M2M relationship between posts and named entities

provide ways to manage user CUD
improve flask app project layout
learn flask
comments
tests
prepare settings_local configs_local templates
allow for setting up the project for a new developer
respect robot rules
client-side form validation
eliminate the need to go to index.html to open front page on dev server
continuous improvement: improve security on client-side code: e.g. CSRF prevention on forms.
continuous improvement: make sure no error during crawling and all extractionws are done correctly
continuous improvement: improve security on server-side code: e.g. is password hashing secure?
continuous improvement: support python 3+
